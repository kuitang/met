# Architecture

Met Navigator: indoor navigation + collection search for the Metropolitan Museum
of Art (Fifth Avenue + The Cloisters). One npm-workspaces monorepo, one deployed
artifact (Fly.io app = static Expo web export + Node API server), one data
artifact (`met.sqlite`) that every client downloads and queries locally.

This file is updated in the same commit as any structural change.

```

The OpenAPI contract `shared/openapi.yaml` (generated types:
`shared/api-types.d.ts`) is the **only** client↔server surface; the seven
routes above are the entire dynamic API. Everything else — autocomplete, full
search, the floor-plan map, Dijkstra routing, positioning fusion — is
client-local code in `shared/` and `apps/mobile/` running against the
downloaded database.

## The one artifact: met.sqlite

Design rule (user-locked): **no client/server index fragmentation**. A single
SQLite file is the source of truth; the server's only relationship to search is
(a) serving the file and (b) holding its own copy to execute LLM-rewritten
queries and validate photo matches.

Tables (built by `data/src/build-db.ts`):

- `objects` — on-view rows (45.5k at full hydration): objectID, accession,
  title, artist, culture, period, classification, medium, tags, synonyms,
  galleryNumber, site (`fifthAve|cloisters`), rotation
  (`permanent|exhibition`), isHighlight, imageUrl, metadataDate.
- `objects_fts` — FTS5 external-content index, `porter unicode61`,
  `prefix='2 3 4'`, over (title, artist, culture, classification, medium, tags,
  synonyms) with query-time weights `bm25(objects_fts,10,8,3,5,2,4,1)`.
  The `synonyms` column is index-time LLM vocabulary expansion
  (`data/src/synonyms.ts`, one-time ≈$0.30): "katana"→"samurai sword",
  culture translations, antiquities nicknames — recall fixed before any
  query-time LLM is involved.
- `galleries(galleryNumber, site, …)` / `amenities` — centroids, floors,
  titles for 463 gallery polygons + 125 amenities.
- `graph_nodes` / `graph_edges` — the routing graph (2,125 nodes / 8,096 edges:
  door, walk, stairs, elevator) derived from Living Map walking linestrings.
- `blobs` — gzipped `galleries.geojson` (room polygons), `amenities.geojson`,
  `routes.geojson`; the map renders entirely from these.
- `meta` — dataVersion etc.

Size: ~32 MB raw / ~10 MB gzip at full 45.5k scale (measured on the interim
full-scale build); the committed snapshot is partial until the in-flight
hydration completes (see Data provenance below).

### How clients get it

`apps/mobile/src/data/DataGate.tsx:DataGate` gates the app: open local copy
first (never blocks on the network), first-run download with a retry screen,
then a fire-and-forget `GET /api/v1/data/version` poll → ETag re-download → hot
swap → persist. The platform seam is `./sqlite`:

- native (`apps/mobile/src/data/sqlite.ts`): expo-sqlite,
  `deserializeDatabaseAsync` + backup-API persist into the document directory.
- web (`apps/mobile/src/data/sqlite.web.ts`): official
  `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`, main-thread in-memory via `sqlite3_deserialize`,
  raw bytes persisted in Cache Storage. **Why not expo-sqlite web** (its wasm
  backend was the plan's flagged alpha risk, and it failed measurement): the
  vendored wa-sqlite.wasm ships **without FTS5**, and its sync worker bridge
  truncates result lengths mod 256 (any sync result >255 bytes is corrupt;
  reproduced and patched locally to confirm, present through
  56.0.5-canary). The official wasm build has FTS5+porter, is natively
  synchronous, and needs no SharedArrayBuffer. Same bytes, same SQL, same
  provider code — exactly the fallback the plan reserved.

Both export the `MetDb` contract (`apps/mobile/src/data/sqlite.ts:MetDb`,
`tryOpenLocal`, `downloadDb`, `fetchServerVersion`).

## Client data layer

`apps/mobile/src/data/provider.ts:DataProvider` is the single interface the UI
sees; `StubDataProvider` (curated stub.json, Gate A) and
`apps/mobile/src/data/SqliteDataProvider.ts:SqliteDataProvider` (real) both
implement it. Selection is bundle-time: `EXPO_PUBLIC_DATA=real` → SQLite.
The provider:

- runs autocomplete/full search through the shared builders
  (`shared/search.ts:buildAutocompleteQuery` / `buildFullQuery`) with
  rank-preserving hydration;
- loads galleries/amenities/graph/geometry once in `create()`;
- `route()` delegates to `shared/routing.ts:buildRouteGraph` + `route` and
  emits `Route.geo` — the node path projected into the map's meter space plus
  the site viewBox — which `apps/mobile/src/components/RoutePolyline.tsx`
  draws as an overlay aligned with the floor map;
- `galleriesGeometry(site, floor)` feeds the map renderer.

## Map rendering

`apps/mobile/src/components/MapGeometry.ts` turns the geojson blobs into a
render model: equirectangular projection around the site bbox center
(`x=(lon−lon0)·111320·cos(lat0)`, `y=(lat0−lat)·110540`, y flipped for SVG;
meters = SVG user units), shoelace centroid/area for label placement, one
per-site viewBox across floors (`buildSiteGeometry`, `availableFloors`,
`resolveGeometryFn`). `apps/mobile/src/components/FloorMap.tsx:FloorMap`
renders it with react-native-svg: memoized room paths, closed galleries
hatched + dimmed, zoom/area-gated labels, data-driven floor chips
(`G|1|1M|2|3|5` today — floors come from the data, not a constant), and
pinch/pan/wheel applied as a screen-space transform so zooming never
re-renders the SVG tree. The venue (Fifth Avenue ⇄ The Cloisters) is **not
map chrome**: FloorMap has no site switcher and renders whatever `site` prop
it is given — the active venue is location state (see Positioning), surfaced
as the second line of the home locate chip and overridden via the locate
sheet's segmented VENUE row. Measured: 204 polygons on
Fifth Ave floor 1, cold paint→first room 431 ms, floor switch 75 ms — no
polygon simplification needed (measured before optimizing).

## Positioning: ranked signals, fused in one state machine

`shared/positioning.ts`. The signal ranking (strongest wins):

1. **Gallery-number entry** → exact room+floor, confidence 1.0.
2. **Artifact lookup** ("I'm next to this") → that object's gallery, 1.0.
3. **Photo** → server `POST /api/v1/locate/photo`: wall-label OCR match
   (deterministic, high confidence) or embedding candidates the user confirms.
4. **GPS** → *wing level only, never a room.*

The GPS ceiling is type-enforced, and it is an eval result, not a policy
choice: `data/evals/reports/gps.md` shows that at realistic indoor accuracy
(65 m, no floor signal on either platform) a naive smallest-room resolver over
200 simulated Great Hall fixes claims **69 distinct rooms across floors and
hits the true room 14% of the time**, while wing-level resolution is stable
(modal wing 51%, at-museum 200/200, 800 m outliers rejected). So
`resolveGpsArea` returns an `AreaAnchor` that **has no gallery field**, and
`RoomSource` excludes `'gps'` — a GPS room claim cannot be expressed.

Fusion semantics (`applyInput`): room inputs always win; a usable GPS fix may
supersede a room anchor only when the room anchor is older than
`ROOM_ANCHOR_DECAY_MS` (4 min ≈ how long before a browsing visitor has drifted
a few rooms), and when it does, the previous floor is retained as
`assumedFloor` ("Floor 2 (assumed)") since GPS carries no floor.
`anchorLevel`/`effectiveConfidence` expose the room→wing decay for display.
Route integration: `onRouteAnchor(progress, anchor, perStepGalleries)` returns
`advance | reroute | none` — checkpoint auto-advance and exactly-once
rerouting per deviation (re-arms after an on-route advance); GPS area anchors
are inert on routes by type. Verified by a scenario simulator
(`shared/positioning.sim.test.ts`) that runs GPS timelines with 40–100 m noise
around real gallery centroids through the real machine, including a 500-random-
fix property test asserting no room claim is ever produced.

**Venue is location state** (gate decision): which building the app shows
(`fifthAve | cloisters`) is part of the position, not a map control.
`applyFusedInput(state, input)` composes venue with anchor fusion under the
coupling rules documented in the `shared/positioning.ts` header: a defined
anchor's site always equals the active venue; explicit inputs (room entry,
locate-sheet manual override, cross-venue object tap) switch venue
unconditionally and clear any other-venue anchor (no floor — not even
`assumedFloor` — crosses buildings); GPS auto-switches the venue (emitting a
`venue-switch` event → dismissible toast) only when the venue wasn't manually
pinned this session and no fresh room anchor exists. `resolveGpsVenue` accepts
fixes up to `VENUE_MAX_ACCURACY_M` (1 km — far looser than area anchoring)
because the venues are ~9.8 km apart while the acceptance radius stays
≤1.35 km, so a usable fix structurally cannot resolve to the wrong venue —
property-tested over 500 noisy fixes at both venues' real centroids, plus
manual-pin and fresh/stale-anchor venue scenarios, in the same simulator.

UI state lives in `apps/mobile/src/components/LocateState.tsx`
(`setAnchor`/`useAnchor`/`anchorForRoom`, plus `useVenue`/`applyVenue` and the
venue-switch toast); the locate sheet (`apps/mobile/src/app/locate.tsx`) runs
GPS-first on open and routes every signal through the shared machine.

## Routing & instructions

`shared/routing.ts`: plain Dijkstra (binary heap, multi-source) over
`graph_nodes`/`graph_edges` rows; `avoidStairs` filters stair edges (elevators
remain). Instructions are templated over the edge sequence, grouped by room,
with door-crossing bearings turned into compass directions: "Exit Gallery 375
through the southwest door into Gallery 374 (European Ceremonial Armor)" /
"Take the stairs to Floor 2". Sample 131→822: 309 m, 24 steps. Runs entirely
on-device (offline routing works; J11 asserts it).

## Search: three tiers, LLM strictly server-side

1. **Autocomplete** (every keystroke, local, p50 0.3 ms): normalized input →
   FTS5 every-token-prefix AND, weighted bm25 + isHighlight boost, gallery
   joined inline. `shared/search.ts:buildAutocompleteQuery`.
2. **All Results** (local): same query + filters (site/floor/classification/
   hasImage/rotation) as WHERE clauses; amenity intent ("restroom") routes to
   the amenities table ranked by graph distance from the current anchor.
   `shared/search.ts:buildFullQuery`, `amenityIntent`.
3. **LLM interpret** (the only server hop, `POST /api/v1/search/interpret`,
   one round trip): the server rewrites *and executes and ranks*, returning
   final results — the client never orchestrates LLM steps.

How the catalog meets Gemini — **never by pasting it** (45k rows ≈ 1M+ tokens:
rejected on latency, cost, and long-context recall during planning). Instead
the prompt carries only the **vocabulary**: distinct classification/culture
value lists generated from met.sqlite (`server/src/vocab.ts:getVocabulary`,
cached per DB handle). Two paths inside `server/src/routes/interpret.ts`:

- **Rewrite (default)**: one `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` call with structured
  output (`server/src/gemini.ts:interpretedQuerySchema`) → `{ftsQuery,
  filters}` → executed against the server's met.sqlite with AND→OR relaxation
  (`shared/search.ts:relaxQuery`). ~$0.0003/query, live p50 ≈ 610 ms.
- **Agentic escalation (rare)**: when the rewrite is weak — `rows < 3 OR
  top-1 bm25 score > −11.5` (threshold measured: healthy top-1 scores
  −12.6…−54 vs low-signal −5.6…−12.1; the score test catches
  "plausible-but-wrong" results that row counts cannot) — flash-lite gets one
  `search_catalog` tool executed in-process, hard-capped at 3 calls.

Gemini integration is one thin client, `server/src/gemini.ts:createGemini`
(`@google/genai` 2.8.0, `responseMimeType`+`responseJsonSchema`, thinking
minimal) — no provider abstraction (Gemini is user-locked). `LLM_MOCK=1`
serves deterministic fixtures (`server/src/llm-mock.ts`) for tests.

## Photo localization

`server/src/routes/locate.ts`: two concurrent server-side paths, one round
trip — (a) label OCR (flash-lite vision reads title/accession off any wall
label; benchmarked 100% on the planning corpus) → deterministic met.sqlite
match; (b) `gemini-embedding-2` query embedding → brute-force cosine against
the precomputed image-vector index (`server/src/embeddings.ts:
loadEmbeddingIndex`/`searchByEmbedding`; sharded Float32Array files in
`data/snapshots/image-embeddings/`, lazy-loaded, ~40 ms at full scale) → top-3
candidates for one-tap confirm. **No LLM image recognition anywhere** —
benchmarks showed retrieval at 90% top-1 / 95% top-5 on real guest photos vs
17–65% for vision-LLM identification (`docs/llm-bench.md`). The index builder
is `data/src/embed-images.ts` (incremental; ≈$4 one-time at 34k images).

## Image proxy

Measured 2026-06-10: `images.metmuseum.org` sends **no** CORS/CORP headers, so
under the server's cross-origin-isolated pages (COOP `same-origin` + COEP
`require-corp`, kept for dev/prod parity) the Met CDN cannot be embedded
directly on web. `server/src/routes/img.ts:imgRoutes` proxies
`GET /api/v1/img/{objectID}` with a disk LRU cache (`DATA_DIR/img-cache/`, cap
`IMG_CACHE_MAX_MB`) and permissive CORP/CORS headers; web clients use it with a
`?v={dataVersion}` cache-buster, native keeps direct CDN URLs (no COEP, saves
egress). ObjectImage shows a fixed-height neutral block with a small Met-red
spinner until the bytes paint (cold proxy fetches read as intentional; zero
layout shift). See `apps/mobile/src/components/ObjectImage.tsx` and
`apps/mobile/src/data/apiBase.ts:apiBase`.

## Nightly self-refresh

`server/src/refresh.ts`: a 60 s-tick scheduler (`startRefreshScheduler`) fires
once per UTC day at `REFRESH_CRON_HOUR` (default 4; `RUN_REFRESH=0` disables).
The job (`runRefresh`): Met API objects delta (`objects?metadataDate=` since
the snapshot ∩ on-view, ≤10 req/s with WAF-aware backoff) → incremental
synonyms → `build-db.ts` into a staging dir → **atomic swap** (fsync, previous
artifact kept as `met.sqlite.prev`, rename, VERSION bump) → in-process handle
reload (`server/src/routes/interpret.ts:reopenInterpretDb`,
`server/src/embeddings.ts:reloadEmbeddingIndex`). Any failure aborts before
the rename; the live artifact is never touched. Manual trigger:
`POST /api/v1/admin/refresh` (Bearer `ADMIN_TOKEN`; 404 when unset, 409 when
in-flight). Clients pick the new version up via the version poll + ETag.

## Abuse protection

`server/src/middleware/ratelimit.ts:llmRateLimit` (per-IP, `RATE_LIMIT_RPM`/
`RATE_LIMIT_BURST`, 429 + Retry-After) on both LLM endpoints, plus a global
daily budget (`LLM_DAILY_BUDGET`, 503 `budget_exhausted` — clients show a
graceful notice, J11 asserts the offline/degraded path). `imgRateLimit`
separately on the image proxy.

## Data provenance & reliability (eval evidence)

Full detail in `docs/DATA.md`; reports regenerate via `npm run evals` into
`data/evals/reports/`. Headlines as of 2026-06-10:

| search-eval.md | PASS | offline goldens **50/50 (100%)** after Phase 2 upgrades (synonyms column + score-aware escalation); live LLM tier 13/13 with 0 escalations, interpret p50 ≈610 ms; autocomplete p50 0.3 ms |
| visual.md | PASS | 9 per-floor SVG renders (polygons + graph + stairs/elevators) in `data/evals/reports/floors/` for human review |
| llm-bench.md | — | model bake-off that locked flash-lite + embedding retrieval; real-guest-photo retrieval 90% top-1 / 95% top-5 |

Sources: Met Open Access API (official, CC0 — but WAF-throttled to ~1.3 req/s
effective, hence hours-long hydrations with resume); Living Map endpoints
behind maps.metmuseum.org (unofficial — ETL'd once, raw tiles committed in
`data/raw/` so geometry never depends on them again; if they vanish, the app
runs on the frozen snapshot). metmuseum.org itself is never scraped
(bot-blocked, and out of etiquette).

**Known state**: the committed `data/met.sqlite` is a partial snapshot (120
objects) while the full 45.5k hydration runs; a watcher rebuilds the DB and
re-runs evals + goldens when it lands. The schema, code paths, and all suites
are row-count-independent (e2e fixtures derive from the live DB at spec load).
The image-embedding index is similarly mid-build (10k+ of ~34k vectors) and
loads whatever shards exist.

  scenario simulator.
- `cd e2e && npx playwright test --project=checks` — fast gate: all screens,
  real-map rendering, HIG conformance sweep (≥44 pt targets, ≥16 px inputs,
  no horizontal overflow at 390 px), data-provider spec (gated on
  `REAL_TARGET`).
- `npm -w e2e run journeys` — J1–J15 acceptance videos against the production
  boot (real provider + `LLM_MOCK=1` server); recordings in `e2e/recordings/`.
  `@live`-tagged variants hit real Gemini under `LLM_LIVE=1`.
- `npm run evals` — data eval reports with hard pass/fail gates.
